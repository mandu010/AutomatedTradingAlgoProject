- This is a Bank Nifty Intraday Trend(Directional) following strategy.
- The setup relies on 3 indicators: Williams Alligator, SupterTrend & PivotPoints.
- The setup is integrated with Telegram, it will send Notification to the user based:
    Whether signal was Found or Not
    -If Found: which Option Strike Price order it placed.
    -Once placed, if Order is Completed with a certain persiod, the script will start sending Trailing Info.
